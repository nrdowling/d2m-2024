## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This is a reference @xie2018bookdown.

You may want to cite references in different formats depending on the surrounding sentential context, e.g.:

Dowling, in her [-@dowling2023d2mr] course, states that Rmarkdown is awesome.

Rmarkdown is awesome [@xie2018bookdown; @dowling2023d2mr; @dowling2021r]

Rmarkdown is awesome [e.g., @xie2018bookdown; @dowling2023d2mr]

Rmarkdown is awesome [e.g., smooth workflow\; @xie2018bookdown; see also @dowling2023d2mr]

Same-year, same-author publications are automatically disambiguated [e.g., @dowling2021r; @dowling2021productive]

We learned all about ggplot [see @wickham2016r4ds, ch. 1]

We learned about ggplot with @wickham2016r4ds [, ch. 1]



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# I just need a basic overview
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Citations will only appear in the references section if they are actually referred to at least once in your document. Including the bibtex entry in your .bib file is not sufficient^[You can capitalize on this in creative ways. For example, if you often write papers on a topic that will share many -- but not all -- citations, you can create a "master" .bib for that topic to use with all papers on that topic. Only the references included in the text will generate in the document.] However, you can specify references that should appear in your bibliography even when they aren't in your text, provided they have entries in your .bib file.

<!-- The "nocite:" meta-info block can appear anywhere in the text, for example here within the text of the paper. -->

<!-- Typically though, the "nocite:" meta-info block is placed here, immediately following the html (above) that generates your refs section. Try uncommenting each of these blocks individually and both together and compare the results. -->
