## Create your goal tibble to replicate

# Run this line to see what your end product should look like
sw.wrangled.goal <- read_csv("data/sw-wrangled.csv") %>% 
  mutate(across(c(hair, gender, species, homeworld), factor)) # this is a quick-and-dirty fix to account for odd importing behavior

# View in console
sw.wrangled.goal 

# Examine the structure of the df and take note of data types
# Look closely at factors (you may need another function to do so) to see their levels
str(sw.wrangled.goal) 



## Use the built-in starwars dataset to replicate the tibble above in a tbl called sw.wrangled
# If you get stuck, use comments to "hold space" for where you know code needs to go to achieve a goal you're not sure how to execute
sw.wranged <- starwars # %>% ...



## Check that your sw.wrangled df is identical to the goal df
# Use any returned information about mismatches to adjust your code as needed
all.equal(sw.wrangled.goal, sw.wrangled.goal)
